# Repository containing development environments created inside docker.

```
The main objectives behind the creation of this repository was idea of a portable programming environment. 
The tools have been configured is such a way that working with them is efficient and that, to a certain 
extend, forces one to learnin new things.

The tools I plan to learn more about as parto of the development of this repository:
 - docker
 - makefile
 - tmux
 - vim 
```
